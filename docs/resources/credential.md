# litellm_credential (Resource)

Manages a LiteLLM credential for storing sensitive authentication information. Credentials can be used to securely store API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data that can be referenced by models and vector stores.

## Example Usage

### Basic OpenAI Credential

```terraform
resource "litellm_credential" "openai_cred" {
  credential_name = "openai-api-key"
  model_id        = "gpt-4"
  
  credential_info = {
    provider = "openai"
    region   = "us-east-1"
    purpose  = "chat-completions"
  }
  
  credential_values = {
    api_key = var.openai_api_key
    org_id  = var.openai_org_id
  }
}
```

### Anthropic Credential

```terraform
resource "litellm_credential" "anthropic_cred" {
  credential_name = "anthropic-api-key"
  
  credential_info = {
    provider = "anthropic"
    purpose  = "text-generation"
  }
  
  credential_values = {
    api_key = var.anthropic_api_key
  }
}
```

### Pinecone Vector Store Credential

```terraform
resource "litellm_credential" "pinecone_cred" {
  credential_name = "pinecone-production"
  
  credential_info = {
    provider    = "pinecone"
    environment = "production"
    region      = "us-east-1"
  }
  
  credential_values = {
    api_key    = var.pinecone_api_key
    index_name = "document-embeddings"
  }
}
```

### Using Credentials with Vector Store

```terraform
resource "litellm_vector_store" "example" {
  vector_store_name        = "my-vector-store"
  custom_llm_provider      = "pinecone"
  litellm_credential_name  = litellm_credential.pinecone_cred.credential_name
  
  vector_store_description = "Example vector store using Pinecone"
  
  vector_store_metadata = {
    environment = "production"
    team        = "ai-team"
  }
}
```

### Multiple Provider Credentials

```terraform
# AWS Bedrock credential
resource "litellm_credential" "aws_bedrock" {
  credential_name = "aws-bedrock-cred"
  
  credential_info = {
    provider = "aws"
    service  = "bedrock"
    region   = "us-east-1"
  }
  
  credential_values = {
    aws_access_key_id     = var.aws_access_key_id
    aws_secret_access_key = var.aws_secret_access_key
    aws_region            = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# Azure OpenAI credential
resource "litellm_credential" "azure_openai" {
  credential_name = "azure-openai-cred"
  
  credential_info = {
    provider = "azure"
    service  = "openai"
  }
  
  credential_values = {
    api_key      = var.azure_openai_key
    api_base     = var.azure_openai_endpoint
    api_version  = "2023-12-01-preview"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `credential_name` - (Required) Name of the credential. This will be used as the identifier for the credential.
* `credential_values` - (Required, Sensitive) Map of sensitive credential values such as API keys, tokens, etc.
* `model_id` - (Optional) Model ID associated with this credential.
* `credential_info` - (Optional) Map of additional non-sensitive information about the credential.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `credential_name` - The name of the credential.

## Import

Credentials can be imported using their name:

```shell
terraform import litellm_credential.example "credential-name"
```

## Security Considerations

* The `credential_values` field is marked as sensitive and will not be displayed in Terraform output or logs.
* Credential values are not read back from the API for security reasons, so they are preserved in the Terraform state.
* Ensure your Terraform state is properly secured when using this resource.
